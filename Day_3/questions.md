1. In your file called `utils.mo`: create a function called `second_maximum` that takes an array [Int] of integers and returns the second largest number in the array.


2. In your file called `utils.mo`: create a function called `remove_even` that takes an array [Nat] and returns a new array with only the odd numbers from the original array.

> ⛔️ Do not use a loop. 


4. In your file called `book.mo` create a custom type with at least 2 properties (title of type **Text**, pages of type **Nat**), import this type in your `main.mo` and create a variable that will store a book.


5. In your file called `book.mo` create a function called `create_book` that takes two parameters: a title of type **Text**, and a number of pages of type **Nat** and returns a book. This function will create a new book based on the parameters passed. 


6. In `main.mo` import the type **List** from the Base Library and create a list that stores books. 


7. In `main.mo` create a function called `add_book` that takes a book as parameter and returns nothing this function should add this book to your list. Then create a second function called `get_books` that takes no parameter but returns an **Array** that contains all books stored in the list.
